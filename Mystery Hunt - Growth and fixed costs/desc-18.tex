This oyster bar owned by Walrus is \mybox{not very popular and not very unpopular}.  Staff are known to be \mybox{grumpy}, but the oysters are always \mybox{fresh}.  The bar has borrowed heavily from \input{1}\hspace{-.048in}, the smallest business to do so, and has \mybox{good relationships with vendors} of \mybox{lemon juice and wine}.\\

For years, the tax agency has puzzled over the Purple Walrus's low costs and low profitability; they wonder where the revenues are going.

%Walrus and the Red Queen are in a long-standing argument over the Wonderland flat tax rate of 30\%.  Walrus argues it is too high; the Queen returns that her businesses pay it too, so clearly the rate is fair.
