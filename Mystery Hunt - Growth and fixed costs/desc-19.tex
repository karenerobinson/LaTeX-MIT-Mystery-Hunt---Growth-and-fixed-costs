This company owns several restaurant brands in Wonderland.  It \mybox{advertises heavily} for all its brands, but since many \mybox{locations are out-of-the-way} and staff \mybox{tends to be grumpy}, the restaurants are generally \mybox{not that popular}---though management claims they are.  It is owned by the Red Queen, who \mybox{receives some cash} from it every year.  She takes pride in the fact that Wonderland Pie is bigger than other restauranteurs (but they have noticed that she still pays her vendors a lot for ingredients).
